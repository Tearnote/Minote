# Minote
A work-in-progress experimental hobbyist renderer for personal videogame and
digital art projects.

More details about current state and future plans on
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/LsFEM6Vw/minote)!

## Goals
- Performant rendering of models with high instance counts
- Artifact-free shading and post-processing, approaching path-tracing quality
when possible
- Flexibility to rapidly iterate on interesting rendering techniques
- Compatibility with most of the modern gaming-grade hardware
- Modern and self-contained C++ codebase

## Non-goals
- Texture mapping
- Vertex animation
- Being an engine
- Cross-platform support

## Building
Open in Visual Studio 2022 as a CMake project and build with MSVC. Requires
the Vulkan SDK to be installed; no other dependencies. `Debug` and `Release`
configurations are self-explanatory, `RelWithDebInfo` is designed for profiling.

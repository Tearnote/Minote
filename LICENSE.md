Tearâ™ª Speaks His Terms License

You are allowed to init and distribute derivative work under the following conditions:
1. You will release the derivative work's source code, and will do it under the same license.
2. You will include a copy of this license.
3. You will provide attribution to the original work on whatever page serves as the primary source of information about the derivative project, such as the project's website or the repository's README file.
4. You will not charge money for the work itself or any part of its functionality. A donation will not provide any functional benefit to the donator outside of a purely visual badge or role. The badge or role will not provide any sort of preferential treatment. In the name of fairness, the copyright holder(s) also guarantee to adhere to this rule.

This work contains both original code and code taken from other sources. Any code that is not original has its origin stated in a comment that precedes the code, and all licensing obligations of the original code are carried out to the best of the author's knowledge and ability. The terms of this license apply only to entirely original code; no attempt is made to re-license the derivative code.

An additional exception is made for snippets of code that are not comparable to the scope of the project as a whole. This, for example, would include code that implements a single rendering technique, or allocation scheme. Such snippets, taken verbatim or derived from, can be used under a permissive MIT license. The spirit of this clause is to encourage mutual knowledge sharing in the computer graphics and game development communities.

Except as stated in this license, the work is provided "AS IS". No other guarantees are provided or implied.
